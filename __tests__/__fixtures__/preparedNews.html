<p>With a name like Cyber Cycles, the strong retro theme is a little surprising from this new
  made-in-Germany component maker. But while Cyber Cranks and Cross Blade forks undeniably harken back to the early days
  of mountain bikes, both combine modern modular tech and performance in that good old retro styling. Build up a rigid
  dropbar mountain bike (or a gravel bike as we tend to call them these days) and Cyber will have your cranks, forks,
  and even stems covered&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I rode a mountain bike with tubular steel cranks &#8211; maybe 20
  years or so? But we got <a>a sneak peek last summer</a> that Cyber was bringing sexy back. On a
  steel <a>Sour Bad Granny</a> belt-drive MTB singlespeed.</p>

<p>Now this year, Cyber Cycles has
  since rolled out 4 versions of their tubular steel Cyber Cranks. Each is welded in Germany from tubular steel. A
  classic no-nonsense crankset to finish off you custom commuter, gravel, trail, all-mountain, or enduro mountain bike.

  </figure>
  <p>The Cyber Cranks are designed and fabricated in the middle of Germany, welded by life-long Italian
    framebuilder <a href="https://www.agresti.de">Stefano Agresti</a>.
    Made of custom cold-drawn US-made air-hardened steel, Cyber cranks feature a standard SRAM 3-bolt direct mount
    interface for 1x chainrings. Or there&#8217;s optional machined alloy 110BCD spiders for 1x or 2x setups. The
    standard
    cranks use an integrated 24mm (Shimano Hollowtech 2 BB compatible) spindle. But this summer, Cyber also added a ST
    square taper version that you can use with old style bottom brackets.</p>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cranks modern modular tubular steel bicycle cranksets, Cyber Cranks OR off-road"></a></figure>
  <p>Cyber Cranks are independently lab
    tested for strength and durability. But the cranks are NOT rated for DH or BMX, and have a rider weight limit of
    110kg
    for their specific discipline.</p>
  <h3>Cyber Cranks &#8211; Pricing, Options &amp;
    Availability</h3>
  <figure><a
      href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cyber-Cycles-Cranks-modern-modular-tubular-steel-bicycle-cranksets_Cyber-Cranks-GR-gravel-bike.jpg"><img

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cranks modern modular tubular steel bicycle cranksets, Cyber Cranks GR gravel" /></a></figure>
  <p>Cyber Cranks retain for 469â‚¬,
    without a chainring or bottom bracket. Lengths are available in 5mm steps from 160-180mm (and maybe outside of that
    range if you ask nicely.) Cyber also offers them in several standard finishes. Raw to see the underlying steel as it
    changes color when welded, but will continue to oxidize with time. Extra Raw which is more like a matte gun metal
    black look stat still reveals a bit of warm steel hues below. Matte nickel plated for a warm durable almost
    titanium-like look. Matte chrome-plated for a bit more shiny silver style. And gloss white or gloss black for 90s
    MTB
    bling. </p>
  <p>Then, you can from 4 options depending on your bike and how you ride: </p>
  <figure><a

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cranks modern modular tubular steel bicycle cranksets, Cyber Cranks ST aquare tape" /></a>
  </figure>
  <p>The Cyber Cranks GR are the lightest
    and narrowest for gravel (or road) with 156mm Q-factor, 46-52mm chainline, and a claimed weight of 475g. Cyber
    Cranks
    OR are the same weight and chainline, but wider at 173mm Q for off-road use. If you go big, pick the Cyber Cranks EN
    which use thicker, stronger arms with a 174mm Q-factor and 52-58mm chainline and a 520g claimed weight. Lastly are
    Cyber Cranks ST a good &#8216;ol square taper crankset that you can use with a conventional bottom bracket on or off
    road &#8211; claimed 460g and 145mm Q &amp; 38-44mm chainline with a 108mm BB.</p>
  <h3>Cyber Cross Blade forks</h3>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cross Blade fork, gravel and XC mountain bike fork with modular legs" /></a></figure>
  <p>Besides, those tubular steel cranks,
    Cyber Cycles also has a new Cross Blade fork, too. Developed as a modern interpretation of 90s rigid MTB forks, the
    Cross Blade features a burly CNC-machined alloy crown that clamps either replaceable chromoly steel or titanium
    legs.
  </p>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cross Blade fork, gravel and XC mountain bike fork with modular legs, replaceable alloy
        crown" /></a></figure>
  <p>Meant to be a modern alternative to
    carbon forks for gravel of rigid XC mountain biking, the forks can be built with up to 430mm axle-to-crown lengths
    depending on what you need. Up top, the machined 7075-T6 aluminum crown clamps to a straight 1 1/8&#8243; Columbus
    Lite steerer, with replaceable stainless hardware. </p>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cross Blade fork, gravel and XC mountain bike fork with modular legs, bonded alloy dropouts" /></a>
  </figure>
  <p>Then, you can pick from lighter and
    more forgiving 1.2mm thick 3/2.5 titanium or heavy-duty 0.9mm thick Columbus CrMo legs. Down below, Cyber bonds
    machined 7075 dropouts onto each leg and connect with a 12or 15mm x100mm DT Swiss thru-axle and flat mount 160mm
    disc
    brake tabs.</p>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Cross Blade fork, gravel and XC mountain bike fork with modular legs, hollow crown detail" /></a>
  </figure>
  <p>Internal able routing is possible
    through the fork leg with 3D-printed guides. And there&#8217;s even the possibility to store a mini-pump inside the
    right fork leg. Officially the new Cyber Cross Blade forks are not yet for sale &#8211; still in a development and
    testing phase. But we saw an early supporter head away from the Bespoked show last week with a duplicate Agresti
    bike
    to this one below, ready to ride. Official availability is slated for next month.</p>
  <h3>MTB &amp; Gravel Bike Stems, too</h3>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Crypto steel gravel and XC mountain bike threadless stem, on-bike" /></a></figure>
  <p>Finishing out the modern retro kit,
    Cyber also has a few custom steel stems, too. A series of 190â‚¬ Roller Stems for either threadless or quill steerers
    feature an integrated cable stop and roller under the stem for canti brake routing. </p>

        alt="Cyber Cycles Crypto steel gravel and XC mountain bike threadless stem" /></a></figure>
  <p>Or the 199â‚¬ Crypto stem, like on
    this bike, offers sleek old school MTB quill stem looks with the stealthy convenient clamping of a modern threadless
    stem</p>

  <p>Remember how we all keep talking
    about how modern gravel bikes are just rigid dropbar mountain bikes from the 1990s? Yeah, Cyber Cycles gets it! And
    make it by hand in Germany.</p>
